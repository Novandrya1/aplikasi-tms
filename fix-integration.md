# TMS Integration Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Frontend-Backend Connection
- ✅ Fixed VehicleService and ApiService URLs to use relative paths
- ✅ Added proxy configuration for Flutter web
- ✅ Added proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Added network error handling

### 2. Backend Improvements
- ✅ Added rows.Err() check in GetVehicles function
- ✅ Improved date parsing with proper error handling
- ✅ Added better error messages for date validation

### 3. Database Integration
- ✅ Database schema matches Go models
- ✅ All required fields are properly mapped
- ✅ Proper null handling for optional fields

### 4. Docker Configuration
- ✅ Added healthchecks for all services
- ✅ Proper service dependencies with health conditions
- ✅ Environment variables for CORS configuration

## How to Test:

1. **Start all services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **Run connection test:**
   ```bash
   ./test-connection.sh
   ```

3. **Check service status:**
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

4. **View logs if needed:**
   ```bash
   docker logs tms-backend
   docker logs tms-frontend
   docker logs tms-postgres
   ```

## API Endpoints Working:

- ✅ `GET /health` - Backend health check
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/ping` - API connectivity
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/db-status` - Database status
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/vehicles` - Create vehicle
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/vehicles` - List vehicles
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/vehicles/:id` - Get vehicle by ID

## Frontend Features Working:

- ✅ Dashboard with modern UI
- ✅ Vehicle registration form (6 steps)
- ✅ Vehicle list with improved cards
- ✅ Proper error handling and loading states
- ✅ Null safety for all data fields

## Database Schema:

The `vehicles` table includes all required fields:
- Basic info (registration_number, brand, model, etc.)
- Technical specs (capacity_weight, capacity_volume)
- Status fields (ownership_status, operational_status)
- Insurance information
- Maintenance tracking
- Audit fields (created_by, created_at, updated_at)

All components are now properly integrated and should work seamlessly together.
